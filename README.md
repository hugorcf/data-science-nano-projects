# Data Science nano projects
These are some of the "nano" projects I have made while learning Python and Data Science.

## Darwin's finches

I perform some very basic data and statistical analysis on data on [Darwin's finches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) in a Jupyter notebook, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/hugorcf/data-science-nano-projects/blob/master/Darwin-finches/Darwin-finches.ipynb).

This analysis was done as practice in Python and basic stats concepts such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and linear regression.

The original data can be found in:

> Grant PR, Grant BR (2014) Data from: 40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island. Dryad Digital Repository. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6g3h

The inspiration for this analysis came from the *Statistical Thinking in Python* courses in [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). The datasets (in csv format) were obtained in [here](https://github.com/johnashu/datacamp/tree/master/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2).

## Spam filtering using Naive Bayes

This small notebook was made following the [Bootstrap-ML](http://sergioagostinho.com/bootstrap-ml) workshop which took place on the 22nd of March 2018 at the Mathematics Department of [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).

This workshop, given by [Sérgio Agostinho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergioagostinho), was a two-hour introductory session in Machine Learning (ML). At the end of the session, the participants were encouraged to implement one of the ML algorithms we explored, the Naive Bayes algorithm, for a simple application of spam filtering.

The materials of the workshop, including the notebook from which this one was inspired, can be found at [Sérgio's GitHub repository](https://github.com/SergioRAgostinho/bootstrap-ml).
