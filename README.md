# Data Science nano projects
These are some of the "nano" projects I have made while learning Python and Data Science.

## Darwin's finches

I perform some very basic data and statistical analysis on data on [Darwin's finches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) in a Jupyter notebook, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/hugorcf/data-science-nano-projects/blob/master/Darwin-finches/Darwin-finches.ipynb).

This analysis was done as practice in Python and basic stats concepts such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and linear regression.

The original data can be found in:

> Grant PR, Grant BR (2014) Data from: 40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island. Dryad Digital Repository. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6g3h

The inspiration for this analysis came from the *Statistical Thinking in Python* courses in [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). The datasets (in csv format) were obtained in [here](https://github.com/johnashu/datacamp/tree/master/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2).
